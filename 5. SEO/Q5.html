		<p>
			Favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square image or
			icon that is associated with a website or web page. It is displayed in
			various places within a web browser, such as in the browser's tab, bookmarks
			or favorites bar, and next to the URL in the address bar. Favicon images are
			often used to provide visual branding, enhance user recognition, and make it
			easier for users to identify and access websites in their browser.
