		<h1>The CSS Flexbox Layout Model vs. the CSS Grid Layout Model</h1>

		<p>
			The CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model are two powerful
			tools for creating layouts in web design, but they have different purposes
			and approaches. Here are the main differences between them, along with
			scenarios where you might choose one over the other:
		</p>

		<h2>CSS Flexbox:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>One-Dimensional Layout:</strong> Flexbox is primarily designed for
				one-dimensional layouts, either as a row or a column. It's best suited for
				arranging items in a single direction.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dynamic Sizing:</strong> Flexbox is great for handling varying
				content sizes within a container. Items can expand or shrink to fill
				available space based on content or specified rules.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Content-Centered:</strong> Flexbox is well-suited for aligning
				content both horizontally and vertically within a container. It's
				particularly useful for centering items.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Order Control:</strong> You can easily change the visual order of
				flex items without altering their source order, which is useful for
				responsive layouts.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>No Grid Structure:</strong> Flexbox doesn't create a grid structure
				with rows and columns; it focuses on distributing space along one axis.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>CSS Grid:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Two-Dimensional Layout:</strong> CSS Grid is designed for
				two-dimensional layouts, creating both rows and columns. It's perfect for
				complex grid structures.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Fixed and Track Sizing:</strong> Grid allows you to set fixed sizes
				for rows and columns, making it ideal for grid-based designs with specific
				layout requirements.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Grid Lines and Gaps:</strong> You can define explicit grid lines and
				gaps between rows and columns, providing precise control over the layout.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Grid Items:</strong> Grid items are placed on the grid and adhere to
				both row and column positions. This enables complex, structured layouts.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Automatic Item Placement:</strong> Grid can automatically place
				items in available cells without the need to explicitly specify positions.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>When to Use Flexbox:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Single-Dimensional Layouts:</strong> Use Flexbox when you need to
				arrange items in a single row or column, such as navigation menus, toolbars,
				or aligning items within a container.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Flexbox is great for handling content of
				varying sizes, ensuring items adjust to available space without breaking the
				layout.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Centering Content:</strong> Flexbox is a good choice for centering
				content horizontally and vertically within a container.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Changeable Order:</strong> If you need to change the order of items
				for responsive design without changing the source order, Flexbox is a good
				choice.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>When to Use CSS Grid:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Two-Dimensional Grids:</strong> CSS Grid is ideal for creating
				complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns, like magazine-style
				layouts or grids of images.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Fixed Layouts:</strong> When you require precise control over the
				size of rows and columns, CSS Grid's ability to set fixed sizes is valuable.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Grid Lines and Gaps:</strong> If you need to create a grid structure
				with explicit rows, columns, and gaps between them, CSS Grid provides
				fine-grained control.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Structured Layouts:</strong> For layouts with items that need to be
				placed in specific grid cells or regions, CSS Grid simplifies this task.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			In practice, it's common to use a combination of both Flexbox and CSS Grid
			within a web layout, leveraging their respective strengths. Flexbox can be
			used for arranging items within components, while CSS Grid can provide the
			overall page structure and alignment. The choice between them depends on the
			specific layout requirements of your project.
