		<h1>Absolute vs. Relative Positioning</h1>

		<h2>Absolute Positioning:</h2>
		<p>
			Absolute positioning is a CSS property that allows you to specify the exact
			position of an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the
			entire document itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			When an element is set to be positioned absolutely, it is taken out of the
			normal document flow, meaning it doesn't affect the layout of other elements
			on the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use properties like <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>,
			<code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> to precisely control where the
			element should be placed in relation to its containing element or the
			document.
		</p>
		<p>
			Elements positioned absolutely are often used for creating overlay elements,
			pop-up windows, or fixed headers/footers that stay in the same place even
			when the user scrolls the page.
		</p>
		<div id="absolute-element">
			Example CSS for absolute positioning:
			<pre>
#absolute-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100px;
  left: 200px;
}
        </pre
			>
		</div>

		<h2>Relative Positioning:</h2>
		<p>
			Relative positioning is another CSS property that allows you to adjust the
			position of an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
		</p>
		<p>
			When an element is set to be positioned relatively, it remains in the
			document flow, and its position can be adjusted using properties like
			<code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and
			<code>left</code>. However, these adjustments do not affect the positions of
			other elements on the page.
		</p>
		<p>
			Relative positioning is often used when you want to nudge an element slightly
			from its default position or when you want to layer elements within a
			container.
		</p>
		<div id="relative-element">
			Example CSS for relative positioning:
			<pre>
#relative-element {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: -10px;
}
        </pre
			>
		</div>
	</body>
